Magnesium burns to form magnesium oxide and produces heat and light. We find that charcoal burns in air. We know that coal, too, burns in air producing carbon dioxide, heat and light. A chemical process in which a substance reacts with oxygen to give off heat is called combustion. The substance that undergoes combustion is said to be combustible. It is also called a fuel. The fuel may be solid, liquid or gas. Sometimes, light is also given off during combustion, either as a flame or as a glow. magnesium and charcoal are combustible substances.In our body food is broken down by reaction with oxygen and heat is produced. We find that for combustion, air is necessary. The candle burns freely in when air can enter the chimney from below. when air does not enter the chimney from below, the flame flickers and produces smoke. the flame finally goes off because the air is not available. In the sun, heat and light are produced by nuclear reactions. The lowest temperature at which a substance catches fire is called its ignition temperature. We find that a combustible substance cannot catch fire or burn as long as its temperature is lower than its ignition temperature. Kerosene oil and wood do not catch fire on their own at room temperature. But, if kerosene oil is heated a little, it will catch fire. But if wood is heated a little, it would still not catch fire. It is essential for a substance to reach ignition temperature to burn. If we continue heating the cup, we can even boil water in the paper cup. The heat supplied to the paper cup is transferred to water by conduction. So, in the presence of water, the ignition temperature of paper is not reached. Hence, it does not burn. The substances which have very low ignition temperature and can easily catch fire with a flame are called inflammable substances. Examples of inflammable substances are petrol, alcohol, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) etc. Water cools the combustible material so that its temperature is brought below its ignition temperature. This prevents the fire from spreading. Water vapours also surround the combustible material, helping in cutting off the supply of air. You have learnt that there are three essential requirements for producing fire. These are: fuel, air (to supply oxygen) and heat (to raise the temperature of the fuel beyond the ignition temperature). Fire can be controlled by removing one or more of these requirements. The job of a fire extinguisher is to cut off the supply of air, or to bring down the temperature of the fuel, or both. If, for instance, a building catches fire, the whole building is the fuel. We find that the gas burns rapidly and produces heat and light. Such combustion is known as rapid combustion. There are substances like phosphorus which burn in air at room temperature. The type of combustion in which a material suddenly bursts into flames, without the application of any apparent cause is called spontaneous combustion. Spontaneous combustion of coal dust has resulted in many disastrous fires in coal mines. Spontaneous forest fires are sometimes due to the heat of the sun or due to lightning strike. It is important to remember that the campfires must be completely extinguished before leaving a forest after a picnic, or a visit. When a cracker is ignited, a sudden reaction takes place with the evolution of heat, light and sound. A large amount of gas formed in the reaction is liberated. Such a reaction is called explosion. Explosion can also take place if pressure is applied on the cracker. The substances which vapourise during burning, give flames. For example, kerosene oil and molten wax rise through the wick and are vapourised during burning and form flames. Charcoal, on the other hand, does not vapourise and so does not produce a flame.
